The code here is the code for the book Beginning JBoss Seam.

In it there are 2 basic types of code. One are items I did in the book as snippets
the other is the Garage Sale, Ticketing System, and Travel Reservations application.

My hope is you can use this code as a way to guide you for basic development of your
JBoss Seam skills.

If you have any questions or find any problems feel free to email me at jnusairat@integrallis.com

Notes --

Each example has a build file with a build.properties.
You will have to change each one's location for deployment.

IF you do not, it is not too big of a deal it will just not auto copy to your deploy directory.
